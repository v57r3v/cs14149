Exam Case TakeLead (TL) is   a   dog   walking   business   located   in   Whangārei,   New   Zealand.   TL’s   founder,   Simon,   started the   business   in the   summer of 2011.   At   the   time   Simon   was   a   keen   cricket   player,   and   his   team   needed   to   raise   funds   in   order   to   attend   the   national tournament   in the following year.   Having already walked his neighbour’s   dog   for a year, Simon sprung to   life with   an   idea   –   walk   all   the   dogs   in   his   neighbourhood   to slowly reach   his funding   goal.With this   new   idea, Simon began attending local   community   events, talking   to   friends   at   school,   and   approaching   various   people   in   dog   parks.   Simon   would   sit   outside   these   locations   with   freshly   printed   poster   advertisements   and   pen   and   paper   sign-   up forms. As   Simon was   on   a   budget,   he   could   not   afford   an   EFTPOS   machine   and   so   all   his   customers   paid with   cash. At first   it was   tough   to   get   any   responses   at   all,   but       as          time       passed,          Simon       was          quickly       growing          his          reputation       as          the   neighbourhood’s go-to dog walker.Over time,   Simon   realised that   many of his customers   began   asking   to   pay   with   card   as   opposed   to   cash,   and   so   he   bought   an   EFTPOS   machine   at   an   affordable   price   from   a   family   friend.    He   also    identified   that    he    had    many    repeat    customers   who   wanted   Simon   to   walk   their   dog   daily.   From   here,   Simon   decided   that   it   would   be   a   great   idea to   introduce ‘daily-walk’ coupons to encourage   more   customers to   sign   up   for    regular,    daily   walks   –    and    these   turned    out   to    be    a    great    success.    To    keep   organised,   Simon   began   storing   information   about   his   customers   and   their   dogs   on   an    Excel    Spreadsheet.   As    his      business    grew    drastically,    he    found   that    as   these   spreadsheets   grew   in   size,   and   they   were   becoming   very   inaccurate,   clunky,   and   messy.    For   example,   the    prevalence   of   popular   dog    names    in    Simon’s   customer   base   meant that   multiple customers are recorded in   the   same   file.Fast-forward    a    few    years    and    Simon’s    business    has    grown    considerably    with    8   employees spread out over 3   locations. Given such   tremendous   success,   Simon   has   ambitious   plans to further develop   his company into the largest   dog walking   business   in   Northland and   is working   hard on   making that   happen.
1 TL’s   Chief   Data   Officer,   Madeleine,   suggested   that   it   was   better   to   use   an   online   sign-up   form   as   opposed   to   the   paper sign-up version. When   TL   implemented this,   Madeleine   also   found   that   the   paper   version   contained   many   unnecessary   questions,   and   so   these   were   later   excluded   in   the   online sign-up forms.
Using the   information from this exam case,   provide:
a. Two   benefits   produced   by   utilising   the   ‘digital’   version   of   the   sign-up   forms.   Explain   your   answer for each benefit.   (4   marks)
b. Two   drawbacks/negatives   of   using   the   ‘digital’   version   of   the   sign-up   forms.   Explain   your   answer for each drawback. (4   marks)
c. One    challenge   that   those    unnecessary    questions    may    have    posed    to   TL’s   overall    Data   Management and why. (4   marks)
d. An   explanation   as   to   how   Garbage    In,   Garbage   Out   (GIGO)   may   occur   when   using   the   paper sign-up forms   at TL, what the   likely   outcome   will   be,   and   how   such   problems   may   be   avoided. (4   marks)

4 Ashley,   TL’s   Chief Technology   Officer   is   frustrated.   She’s   been   asking   Simon   for   funding   to   move   away   from   using   Excel   to   store   their   customer   data.   She   believes   using   a   database   will   be   more   efficient, easier to   use, and will   be able to   handle the   ever   increasing   amount   of   data   the   business   is storing.
Simon   has finally agreed to   provide the funding for Ashley to   make this   happen, but   has some   specific requirements for this implementation.
· The database   must   be able to   handle all of the data   requirements for at   least   the   next   10   years.
· The work   must   be finished within the   next four weeks, as Simon needs Ashley to focus   on   already   planned office fit out upgrades   after that.
· Ashley cannot   use existing staff to   help   her with the   implementation as they are   all   busy.   However, Simon   has approved a   business case for her to   hire   two   contractors   to   assist.
a.   Explain whether the work   required qualifies as a   project.   If you   believe   that   it   does   meet   the   requirements    of    a      project,    state      four      characteristics      about      the      work      that      results      in      it   qualifying   as   a   project.   If   you   believe   that   it   does   not   meet   the   requirements   of   a   project,   state   which   of   the   four   project   management   characteristics   it   does   not   meet.   Provide   an   explanation for your answer. (10   marks)
b. What   is the time constraint?   (2   marks)
c. What   is the cost constraint?   (2   marks)
d.   It   soon   becomes   clear that   the   team   of 3 will   not   be   able   to   complete   the job   in four   weeks   Suggest   one way that Ashley   can   still   proceed,   and the   impact   on   the   "quality”   of the   work.   (6   marks)
e. Ashely   knows   how   important   this   is   to   the   business,   and   therefore   to   Simon.   However,   she   is   not   sure   how   and   when   to   update   him   on   any   progress.   Explain   how   using   the   Agile   Methodology    might   assist   Ashely    in    ensuring   that    Simon    is    up   to    date   on   the   work.    (8   marks)

5 Although the   dog walking   business   has   been   very   profitable   over   the   years,   Simon   is   now   looking   to   take   things   to   the   next   level.   One   of   the   options   available   to   him   is   to   partner   with   various   companies   within   the   wider   pet   industry.   He   has   been   approached   by   a   large   pet   food   franchise   who   are   interested   in   the   valuable   data   he   has   collected.   This   data   includes   customers   details,   how much they spend, dog breed,   and frequency   of engagement.Simon   knows   that   this   partnership   will   be   very   profitable.   Provide   two   security   and   two   ethical   considerations   Simon   should   be   aware   of   when   providing   access   to   this   data   to   the   pet   food   franchise.      For    each    consideration,      recommend      one      way      that      the      risk      can      be      mitigated      or   minimised.   Explain and justify your recommendations.

6 Simon   has   decided to   proceed with the   pet food   partnership   (described   in   Question   5). As   part   of   this   lucrative   deal,   both   parties   will   share   all   the   data   they   have   on   their   customers.   Some   of the   information   the   pet   food   franchise   will   provide   to   TL   includes:   the   amount   and   type   of   pet   food   purchased, location, customer details, and   dog   breed.
In class, we discussed two data   mining   techniques   that   can   help   Simon   and   the   pet   stores   to   gain   useful information.
a.   Provide   a    brief    description    of    each    technique    and    a    short      explanation      about    why    this   technique will   be useful for both TL and the   pet food franchise.   (10   marks)
b.   For   each   technique,   provide   one   example   of   a   potential   piece   of   information   that   could   be   beneficial   for   TL,   and   one   potential   piece   of   information   that   could   be   beneficial   for   the   pet   food company.   (4   marks)
